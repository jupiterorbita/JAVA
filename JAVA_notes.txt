double:  floating point numbers like 3.14159265 they are far more precise.
char: store a single character, like '$' or 'A'.

Object Types

Integer: The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type int into an object.
Long: The Long class wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object.
Boolean: The Boolean class wraps a value of the primitive type boolean in an object.
Double: The Double class wraps a value of the primitive type double in an object.
Character: The Character class wraps a value of the primitive type char in an object.
String: Represents a sequence of characters, like a Python string.
